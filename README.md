## Description

This is a simple (and unfinished) tech blog app using Handlebars and Tailwind CSS.

## Installation

Run "npm i" to install dependencies, "npm run seed" to add the seed data(if using locally), and "npm run watch" to run nodemon. 

## Usage

Use this as a guideline to build your own tech blog app. All the functionality is there, some pages are yet to be styled.
